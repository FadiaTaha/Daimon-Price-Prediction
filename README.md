# Daimon-Price-Prediction
I have two dataset. I have to predict the price depend on old dataset with the same columns name. The difference between the two dataset is df1 with price and df2 without. I saw the best solution for this problem is to use concatenation to combine df1 and df2. This make it easy because I can predict the price as missing value in the column.
